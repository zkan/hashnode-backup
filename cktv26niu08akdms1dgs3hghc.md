* Mac Mini M1 (16GB)
* DELL S2721DGF - 27" IPS 2K Monitor
* Keychron K4 Keyboard
* Logitech MX Master 3 Mouse
* Maono AU-A04 Microphone
* Razer Kiyo Webcam (I'd not recommend for Mac users since the driver doesn't support Mac yet)
* INDESK (150x75 cm) Standing Desk

And my last piece of the setup has just arrived today! ðŸ˜†
